# Anime Facts

## Info -

- A beautiful app to know some unique facts about some popular animes built by consuming [This API](https://chandan-02.github.io/anime-facts-rest-api/).
- This App is built using [mobX](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx). Here I have experimented with dart mobX for usecases like multiple stores in a single screen and different stores for different screens.
- On clicking an anime card in the home screen it leads to the facts screen where unique facts about the respective anime are displayed in randomly colored cards. These colors change everytime you enter the facts screen by clicking an anime card in the home screen.
